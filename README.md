Here I used __Artificial Intelligence__ in diagnosing plant diseases. Various diseases like early blight and late blight immensely influence the quality and quantity of the potatoes and manual interpretation of these leaf diseases is quite time-taking and cumbersome. Therefore I created a simple <b>Convolutional Neural Network Architecture</b> to classify <b>Potato Leaf Diseases</b>. Initially I collected ready-made data from internet. Then due to small size of dataset, I used one of the simple and effective method, called <b>Data Augmentation</b> to increase the size of dataset as well as to reduce overfitting of our model. At the end built an Deep Learning Model to detect or classify Potato Leaf Diseases and got a __test accuracy of 97%.__

<b>Dataset Source : https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village</b>

<b>Sample Output : </b> The output is showing 3 thing's. 
  * <b>Predicted Class.
  * Actual Class.
  * Confidence (how confident our model is.)</b>
